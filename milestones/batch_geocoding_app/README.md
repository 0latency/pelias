We are hoping to provide an accessible cross-platform desktop application that will allow users to geocode large
batches of data. This will be the only batch solution for geocoding that we will provide in the foreseeable future.


## Functionality

- Add ability to detect app updates and prompt user to install them
- Add About box
- Update mapping code to work with large volumes of dots
- [Only list active api keys](https://github.com/dianashk/batch-search-app/issues/6)
- Complete [pre-release checklist](https://github.com/dianashk/batch-search-app/issues/1)


## Operations

- Host packages on S3
- Implement landing page


## Documentation

- Document user flow with screenshots


## Validation

- Test packaged application on various platforms (Windows,MacOS,Linux)
- Determine the largest file size the app can support (in number of rows?)
