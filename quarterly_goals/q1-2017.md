# Quarterly Goals (Q1 2017)

## Features

### [Alt-Names](/milestones/alt_names/)

Allow users to search for a place with administrative hiearchy names specified in English as well as 
the native language of that region. 

### [Add TIGER](/milestones/tiger/)

Incorporate US TIGER address range data into the interpolation build. This will ensure that we have
full address coverage in the US. 
 

### [Coarse Reverse Geocoding](/milestones/coarse_reverse/)

>_Note: this milestone is a carry-over from Q3-2016_

The current implementation of coarse reverse geocoding is problematic and often returns incorrect results. 
We will switch over to a true point-in-polygon solution when the query specifies the “coarse” alias or any 
of the administrative layers in the filters.

## Infrastructure

### [OSS Community](/milestones/community_building/)
This is an ongoing goal that we plan to act on during every quarter, so don't be surprised to see it 
repeated every quarter.

### Revisit fastly caching configuration

### Improve installation and build process
>_Note: this milestone is a carry-over from Q3-2016_

Our vagrant build has fallen behind and is now broken, while many users still attempt to use it 
to setup a local installation of Pelias. We need to either fix vagrant or build a new system that will
allow local setup of Pelias.

### Make index snapshots publicly available
